# Coop Analytics

A brand wants to run an ad campaign and direct traffic to a retailer's site. To
enable more advanced bidding strategies, the brand's ad account needs to receive
conversions. Usually this is achieved by adding a JavaScript tag to the website,
but in this setup, the brand doesn't own the website, and a retailer may not
wish to modify their website to send conversions to a 3rd party Ads account.

Coop Analytics facilitates coop agreements, by using data from the retailer's
Google Analytics 360 account, to identify brand conversions and share these back
with the brand for conversion reporting.

## How It Works?

First, a brand and retailer come to an agreement for which products will be
promoted, and share the product SKUs, and agree a set of [UTM parameters](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters).

As an example, let's say that Global Brand Inc. would like to promote a pair of
socks on Retailer ABC's website. This would be the data flow:

1. Global Brand Inc. would like to promote these socks on the Retailer ABC's
   website:

   https://retailer-abc.com/products/global-brand-inc-socks.html

1. Global Brand Inc. set up a campaign in their own Ads account, with the agreed
   UTM parameters:

   https://retailer-abc.com/products/global-brand-inc-socks.html?utm_source=gbi_brand&utm_campaign=123

1. Global Brand Inc. enables [Auto-tagging](
   https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3095550) in their Google Ads
   account, so when a user clicks the link, a [GCLID](
   https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9744275?hl=en-GB) is also
   appended to the URL.

   https://retailer-abc.com/products/global-brand-inc-socks.html?utm_source=gbi_brand&utm_campaign=123&gclid=987zyx

1. Google Analytics on Retailer ABC's website will capture the GCLID and UTM
   parameters. No action is needed.

1. Retailer ABC sets up the [Google Analytics 360 BigQuery export](
   https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437618?hl=en) in their own
   Google Cloud Project. Global Brand Inc. will not have access to this.

1. Retailer ABC runs the SQL scripts in this project to find conversions for
   products that Global Brand Inc. are advertising. These scripts then look back
   30/60/90 days and determine if a click ever came from one of the brand's
   campaigns, by using the UTM parameters. Notes:

   - The look back window can be configured to any time period.
   - The attribution method in this code is any click, however this could be
     adapted to use first click or last click attribution, if desired.
   - There is flexibility as to what a conversion actually is. This code
     provides examples using page detail view, adding a product to basket, and
     making a purchase.

1. Once the converted clicks that originated from Global Brand Inc.'s campaign
   have been identified, the date & time of the conversion, the conversion value
   and the GCLID are stored in a table.

   |GCLID  |Conversion Datetime|Conversion Value|
   |-------|-------------------|----------------|
   |abc-123|01/02/2021 12:58   |11.99           |
   |xyz-854|01/02/2021 16:12   |23.98           |
   |dkd-954|02/02/2021 09:43   |11.99           |

1. This conversion table sits within Retailer ABC's cloud project. This table is
   shared with Global Brand Inc. Notes:

   - How the data is shared can be flexible:
     - The simplest solution is to create a separate BigQuery dataset that
       contains [a view of the brand's data](
       https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/share-access-views), and share this
       with the brand. This project creates this data, but does not share the data
       with the brand.
     - Alternatively, [the data can be exported from BigQuery to Cloud Storage](
       https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data) and that shared with
       the brand.
     - Or there are other ETL alternatives that could be used, if there are other
       specific restrictions/requirements.
   - **Key point**: The brand's Ads account generated the GCLIDs. A brand can
     [report on the GCLIDs](
     https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports/click-performance-report)
     even if no data is shared. The retailer is sharing a subset of the GCLIDs
     back with the brand; the ones that converted.

1. Global Brand Inc. reads the data, and reports this back to Google Ads via the
   [Offline Conversion API](
   https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/samples/upload-offline-conversion)


## Prerequisites

- The brand will pay 100% of the costs.
- The retailer must:
  - Be a [Google Analytics 360](
    https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics-360/) customer ([the
    BigQuery export](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437618?hl=en)
    is only available to Analytics 360 customers.)
  - Have [E-Commerce tracking](
    https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1037249?hl=en) set up.
  - Have a Google Cloud Project with access to [BigQuery](
    https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).
